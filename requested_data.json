Now I\u2019m 22 and have received a letter from DCFS that my 2 year old half brother from my mom has been removed from her and her boyfriend\u2019s house for the 3rd time and the state is asking that my wife and I take him in to foster to adopt. My first reaction was to say hell no as I\u2019m already a young parent to my child and shit is hard. At the same time though he deserves to have a normal household and I couldn\u2019t imagine my life if my dad and step mom didn\u2019t raise me. My wife suggested we consider it to give him a chance at life. We\u2019ve talked about fostering in the far future due to a traumatic miscarriage that we endured recently, then this fell into our lap yesterday. I\u2019m worried that my brother will bully and torment even though he is young, genetics play a role. I\u2019m very conflicted about this whole ordeal and am mostly concerned about raising my own kid first. My wife agrees with my concerns and says it is ultimately up to me, but I\u2019m not sure I want to take in the responsibility of becoming a legal guardian to my half brother.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884799,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"WIBTA if I left my brothers fate up to the state?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex9egs\/wibta_if_i_left_my_brothers_fate_up_to_the_state\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"helloweirdo26","author_created_utc":1459016767,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_wo4q0","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580577760,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex9dwo","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","link_flair_css_class":"not","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"35ab95ec-0b14-11e5-87b6-0efd95e46dfd","link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":15,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex9dwo\/aita_for_attempting_to_keep_my_students_out_of\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587271367,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Upfront apologies for formatting. I\u2019m also trying to be a vague as possible, let me know if you need clarification. \n\nI am a teacher at a very small private school, which has announced it will be closing at the end of the year. The owners are obviously upset, but did not provide an option for the school to remain open when they announced the closure. Some of the parents have since tried to form a coalition to help save the school and involve the students by making fundraising posters. (Relevant info: the amount of fundraising we would have to do FAR exceeds what some students and poster boards are capable of. This mission is doomed to fail unless someone wins the powerball or finds a rich benefactor.)\n\nInstead of telling my students to make one, I gave them the option to vote (I have less than 10 students). These kids are teenagers, and so I think they\u2019re old enough to decide for themselves. \nThe owner of the school saw this and exploded, yelling at my students and calling them selfish and saying that they were ungrateful, bad kids. I am not paraphrasing, and not exaggerating. Several of them burst into tears, and when I tried to go and apologize to my boss, I was also yelled at and was subject to some less-than-professional conversation. I was trying to take responsibility, as I had told my students that the school closing was between the owner and the other involved adults, their job is to be kids. \nI might be the AH for this, because I discouraged my students from getting involved in what I thought to be adult matters, but clearly the owner thought differently and took this as apathy. This person did not apologize or speak to any of my students again, and instead let them go into the weekend with the thought in their heads that they are bad kids.\n\nI think that these students should not burden themselves with finances and adult matters. The owner thinks that I should have not taken a vote and should have told them to make a poster and encouraged them to be involved with the fundraising.\n\nAITA?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884799,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA

though I am going to try not to be revealing; I\u2019ve made a throwaway account just in case as I\u2019m quite active on reddit and use the same user name for a number of different platforms.\n\nI started my current job just after new year, it\u2019s a corporate environment in a large company. The company trade all year round; but their main profit generating season is late spring to early summer. The rest of the year is mainly spent either analysing\/learning from\/reporting on the last season or preparing for the next one.\n\nOne thing I liked about this company is that it has a clear and transparent pay structure. Every role is assigned a \u201cpay band\u201d with about ten scale points in it. Every successful performance management meeting moves you up a scale point until you reach the top. Now, like all new starters I was employed at the bottom of the scale - which is relevant because at the bottom end the jumps are several thousand; but they get smaller as you near the top.\n\nNow the pay progression policy, that I read carefully before I signed; simply said \u201c[PM] takes place on an annual basis, with a midterm review half way through the performance management cycle.\u201d\n\nWe got an email a few days ago about \u201cMid-Term reviews for PM\u201d and I made an appointment with my line manager. I had assumed that I would set targets; have theme reviewed in summer and then have my pay rise\/new targets next January assuming a met them... but no.\n\nMy manager told me that \u201cdue to the nature of the business\u201d annual reviews always take place in late summer through the fall and mid-terms February through April. As I had missed the last annual review I would be set \u201cshort term targets to settle [me] in\u201d but even if I met them, I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for a pay raise in summer.

He proposed to me 4 months into our relationship and at that time I felt despite certain differences in our lifestyles and values he was the right one. I mean a couple doesn't have to like the exact same things right? For example, my husband is a HUGE sci-fi fan and that genre is never really my thing. I on the other hand love reading romantic books, such as Twilight or Fifty Shades of Grey. \n\nAnyway, the story started a month ago when my husband was finishing showering and I was brushing teeth by the sink. He was about to step out of the bathtub, but out of nowhere he asked if I could sing the song \"Also sprach Zarathustra\". I had no clue what he was referring to, then he hummed a little bit and I was like \"oh I know that song\". So I followed along, he waited until I reached the high note of the song and then he stepped out of the bathtub, as if I was his background music and he was some kind of actor in a movie. I'm not good at describing music so I have a YouTube link here, [2001 A Space Odyssey Opening](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e-QFj59PON4), he stepped out exactly at 0:25. We both found it very funny at the moment and I even said hey that was smart.\n\nNow I regret saying that. Because in the next few weeks he's been asking me to sing this song as his background music for EVERY SINGLE THING he does at home, or else he would not finish showering, getting out of bed, eating the last bite of pizza, or turning off the TV. \n\nMy birthday was last week and he bought me this Japanese snack gift box. I was very excited to finally receive the gift, but he wouldn't completely open the box unless I sing \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" and of course he opened it at the high note I was previously talking about. I'm not super familiar with the song, so I made a mistake in the beginning and he asked me to do it again. I finally got tired of this whole ridiculous thing so I told him to f\\* off. Now he's upset at me and hasn't spoken with me for three days. \n\nAITA for doing that?\n\n[Update] Thank you for all your comments. To answer the question whether I had told my husband to stop before I cursed at him, I didn\u2019t explicitly speak up that I didn\u2019t like the joke any more but I did roll my eyes at him several times.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884795,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for telling my husband to f* off after he relentlessly requests that I sing \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" for whatever he does at home?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex970f\/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_f_off_after_he\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"LordoftheScrub0","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_5kmvdf5c","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580576797,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex94z5","is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":true,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex94z5\/aita_getting_into_a_fight_with_my_stepmom_and_dad\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":"moderator","retrieved_on":1587271260,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[removed]","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884795,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA Getting Into A Fight with My stepmom and Dad.","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex94z5\/aita_getting_into_a_fight_with_my_stepmom_and_dad\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"bornIN04_","author_created_utc":1580507094,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_5kmvaikx","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580576789,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":1580585457,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex94w5","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","link_flair_css_class":"not","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"35ab95ec-0b14-11e5-87b6-0efd95e46dfd","link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":22,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex94w5\/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_being_a_spoiled\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587271259,"score":17,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"My sister(17F) and I(15M) are white kids born and raised in Honolulu hawwii and if you know anything about hawwii is that we have a massive homeless population.

I myself, an USAF vet, know what he went through. He was stuck in there for 8 months.\n\nFor non military types 2 months is how long BMT lasts in the Air Force. While I wouldn't say it's as physically demanding as the rest of them, there is a heavier implication on independent thought, mental acuity and academics. It's designed to break you from a civilian into an Airman and be what the USAF needs you to be.\n\nHe was in there, in that kind of environment for 8 months. He's very bitter about it as he fought tooth and nail and by all rights had been cleared to go back into rotation with another flight several times over. (Basically he'd join a group that was on the week he left.) But for whatever reason whatever brass asshole decided that he didn't belong.\n\nNow I have a small collection of stuff from my time in the service, dress blues, ABU's, and some stuff like that, all too small for me now! They're stuffed away somewhere in the attic i'm sure. Anywho, onto the point. While he was in BMT he was awarded what's called the small arms expert marksmanship ribbon, a ribbon (those things you can see military guys wearing on their uniforms instead of full medals,) and he was proud of it. When you go through the process of an entry level separation (you didn't serve long enough to get graded as honorable, dishonorable, etc.) like he did, you don't get to keep any ribbons like that. We were talking about shit the other night over drinks and he just mentioned it casually but I could tell from the look on his face he was pretty devastated about it, well I've got some of my service ribbons and medals in a nice display case. Never really have much cared for them. I also happen to have that ribbon so I figured, you know what, he fucking earned it, and gave mine to him. Closest I think I've ever seen him to crying.\n\nHis GF called me an asshole when she heard about it and just went on and on and on about how \"he didn't earn it\" and \"it's a disrespect to all active service members\" to the point that he tried giving it back to me last night she'd been beating him up over it.\n\nIt's my fucking ribbon, it's my fucking brother, but that said, AITA?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884780,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for giving my brother my Air Force Ribbon?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8ywl\/aita_for_giving_my_brother_my_air_force_ribbon\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","awarders":[],"can_gild":false,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580576149,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex8yv2","is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":31,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8yv2\/aita_for_shouting_at_my_father_for_calling_me_the\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":"deleted","retrieved_on":1587271151,"score":32,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[deleted]","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884780,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for shouting at my father for calling me the wrong name?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8yv2\/aita_for_shouting_at_my_father_for_calling_me_the\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"blueroots15","author_created_utc":1580575648,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_5kuqpzk6","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580576139,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex8ys3","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#b8001f","link_flair_css_class":"ass","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"90fe04ea-b1cc-11e3-a793-12313d21c20d","link_flair_text":"Asshole","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":54,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8ys3\/aita_for_yelling_at_my_daughter\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587271150,"score":62,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"\nI(46,M) have been helping my(17,F) daughter apply to colleges.

Hi. I (24M) had new neighbours a bit more than a year ago. They are a couple that are both a bit younger than me.\n\nQuickly I realised that the girl would not mind yelling as soon as she was in an argument. This was happening a lot. It gets really upsetting when wanting to sleep. She is the kind of girl that never said hi to me, even though her boyfriend is pretty chill.\n\nI have also found out that the wall is pretty thin and that depending on the room they are in, I can hear everything. I basically know way too much about their private life than I want to.\n\nFew months after they arrival, she saw me having a drink in the apartment of two new girls that live on the same floor as us. This same night, she went crazy, yelling that those girls are whores and are trying to fuck everyone in the building, including her boyfriend. She yelled up to 1AM. I couldn't sleep. I saw her boyfriend alone few days later and told him that they are making way too much noises. I asked if I should knock on the wall when they were getting annoying, but he told me that I probably shouldn't as it would juste make his girlfriend madder. Instead, he was going to be more quieter.\n\nAbout 8 months go by. They were making less noises than before, but still, sometimes I had to be tolerant, even though it impacted my sleep schedule.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I got a bit too noisy with a girl late at night. They knocked on the wall. I got pretty upset about it because of the hypocrisy. I didn't get a chance to talk with them about it as I was going to leave for a month and half trip.\n\nSince I came back from my trip, I've been woken up every nights around 00:00-00:30 because they were talking really too loudly. At first, I thought that I would be the bigger man and would tolerate it. But yesterday night, this was too much, I finally, after a year, knocked on the godamned wall. I heard the girl say \"Did the piece of shit actually knocked on the wall?\".\n\nToday, I got an opportunity to talk with them. I first told the girl my name and explained to her that now she could just call me \"Tim\" instead of \"The piece of shit\". Then without being able to say anything else, she went mad about me making noises 3 months ago, how it was unacceptable, how I should be ashamed. So, I apologized, I said that I fucked up at the time and I should have made less noise. Then, I told her the whole story about how her boyfriend told me to never knock on the wall, but that they knocked as soon as I made noises. I explained that I really have a hard time sleeping properly. She didn't want to know any of this. The guy was nodding his head when I was looking at him but never took part in the argument.\n\nI stayed as calm as possible. When leaving, I told them that I didn't want to start any war with them and that we should just make each other life easier.\n\nMaybe it matters to say that despite all the time they made noise, I never heard them having sex (so maybe they are super quiet, I don't

have maintained the same friend group since the start of HS. We would hang out every day and smoke weed after school, then go home and talk more on discord for hours. During the summer in-between junior and senior year of HS almost 2 years ago, one of my closest friends, let\u2019s call him A, started to go into drugs other than weed. When we were hanging out A told me that he took a Xan the day before and he also took one before coming to hang out with me. This was surprising because everyone in my friend group said we would never do anything other than smoke weed, including A.\n\nAfter this day, I, along with my entire friend group and entire school, never heard anything from A again. We all tried contacting him through phone, text, social media, etc. Nothing. He completely ghosted us. This really hurt me because he was one of my best friends and I didn\u2019t know if I did anything wrong. Him completely cutting contact with me made me depressed, as it would with anyone who loses one of their closest friends completely out of the blue. What really hurt me was how easily he did this, I never even got a text from him telling me he was okay or that he just didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. At the start of senior year, he was unenrolled in our school. \n\nA few months ago I received a text from A asking me how I\u2019ve been, and asking if I wanted to hang out with him. I said yes because I wanted to talk after almost 2 years of never hearing from him. I invited him over and he came that night.\n\nWhen A came, he was a completely different person than the one I remember. It was like a different person was in his body. When we talked, all he talked about was his religion, spiritual shit, and gods plan for him. When I asked him why he had ghosted me and the rest of our friend group, he said he had a spiritual vision telling him to cut all drugs and drug related things out of his life, so he cut all of us off. This angered me because if he told us I wouldn\u2019t have ever smoked or talked about drugs in front of him as my friendship with him was more important than drugs.\n\nWhen A was about to leave, he told me that he hoped that we could hang out again. I, wanting to be honest, told him that I didn\u2019t want to have any relationship with him. He asked why, and I said that although I am happy that he found a calling towards his religion, he still really hurt me by completely ghosting me for almost 2 years. I told him I did not forgive him for that. I also told him that he had completely changed as a person, he wasn\u2019t who I was friends with in high school. I get how people grow and that you just need to accept that, but with his personality now, he is just not someone I want to hang out with. After that he left and I could tell he was visibly sad. \n\nA had really hurt me and I am just not ready to forgive him. I don\u2019t think I ever will.

I was getting some dirty looks throughout from some people but didn't respond, though I got a lecture from my parents when we got home about how I should have gotten something more appropriate. \n\nAs I said the bride\/groom didn't have a problem, so I don't see why anyone else should.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884774,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for wearing a black suit to a wedding?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8h37\/aita_for_wearing_a_black_suit_to_a_wedding\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","awarders":[],"can_gild":false,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580574000,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":1580604408,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex8f18","is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":16,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8f18\/aita_for_telling_my_mother_off_about_being_clean\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":"deleted","retrieved_on":1587270908,"score":6,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[deleted]","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884774,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for telling my mother off about being clean??","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8f18\/aita_for_telling_my_mother_off_about_being_clean\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":true,"archived":false,"author":"lovable___mouse","author_created_utc":1580573685,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_5kuid1zp","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580573995,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":1580605991,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex8ezr","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","link_flair_css_class":"not","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"35ab95ec-0b14-11e5-87b6-0efd95e46dfd","link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":675,"num_crossposts":1,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex8ezr\/aita_for_taking_extra_slices_of_bread_at_an_event\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587270906,"score":3861,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Me and my GF were both at a fancy-ish dinner (about as fancy as you can get for 20 year olds) for a club on campus, that had catering.\n\nOur table was the last to get food so I go, I grab a helping of potatoes, some rice, some greens, and 3 slices of bread (more like baguettes).

my dads house caught on fire about a month ago, and he and my step mom needed a place to stay. I only lived a few blocks over from them and I have a guest bedroom on my side of the duplex I live in, so it was the best choice. Their other option was staying on a futon at her sisters house, so I opened my house to them. I only had three rules: 1) clothing must be worn outside their bedroom. My step mom likes to walk around naked\/in her underwear at their house, which is fine, but I didn\u2019t want to walk in or bring friends home and see her 45 year old butt in my living room or something. 2) don\u2019t touch my prepped meals. I meal prep every Sunday, I asked if they\u2019d like to participate and they said no, so then I told them not to touch the meals or else it would throw my week off, and they said fine. 3) don\u2019t use my new Tupperware. For my birthday in November, my mom bought me a really nice set of teal colored, collapsible Tupperware, and I\u2019ve been treating them nicer than I probably should. Almost all my Tupperware is stained, and I\u2019ve been doing my best to keep the new ones nice for as long as possible. I even put the set in a different place so that there would be no confusion, and there was other Tupperware they were free to use.\n\nWell, last night I got home really late because I went out with some friends, and saw that my dad had made soup for dinner. And they put the leftovers in my biggest, newest, nicest Tupperware container. I moved it into a different container as soon as I saw, but it was too late. My teal Tupperware was now stained a gross orange color. I let it soak overnight, even though I knew it was no use.\n\nThis morning when I woke up I asked them about it and my step mom goes \u201coh, well I wasn\u2019t sure if it would fit in the next biggest size in the old Tupperware, and I figured you didn\u2019t want Tupperware crowding your fridge, so I just put it in there\u201d I asked her if she remembered me telling them they were not allowed to use my new Tupperware, and she said yes. So I asked why she thought it would be okay and she just said \u201cI just told you why. It\u2019s just Tupperware, get over it.\u201d My dad didn\u2019t say anything. I told her she needed to get in her car, drive to the store and buy me a new version of the exact same Tupperware container. She tried to protest, but I told her she could either do it, or leave. Finally, she stormed out and came back an hour later with a replacement.\n\nWell, they are pissed now. My dad less so, but he still thinks I was too harsh because I \u201cdon\u2019t like her\u201d. I\u2019ve never fought with this woman, never done anything to make anyone think I don\u2019t like her. I\u2019ll admit that she\u2019s a little strange, but she\u2019s usually nice enough and we get along fine 99% of the time. But to me she blatantly ignored what I asked her to do, and even though the Tupperware was still usable, she should have to replace it. AITA?\n\nEdit: their house did not burn down. The kitchen caught fire. They just have to renovate the kitchen and a bit of the living room, they didn\u2019t lose everything in their house.\n\nEdit 2: I guess I should explain the significance of this Tupperware. Not only did my mom buy it for me, but it\u2019s one of two things in my kitchen that I got new when I moved out on my own. Everything else was hand me downs from family members.\n\nEdit 3: so, it\u2019s been a few hours. I apologized to my step mom for freaking out and making her leave so early in the morning to replace it, and explained why it was such a big deal. She told me that at 21, I shouldn\u2019t expect to have nice things because it just doesn\u2019t happen like that when people move out on their own. I don\u2019t understand the logic, I shouldn\u2019t expect nice things so when I do get nice things they should be wrecked? Whatever. They\u2019ll be out of my house in about 2 weeks, just gotta live with it until then.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884770,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA

Three months go by with no Pickles.\n\nI text Pickles to check if she is still interested. She says yes and that she will come on Thursday of the week I texted her. Another month goes by.\n\nI'm feeling doubtful at this point and ask Pickles if she's still interested as she said she was coming four months ago. She says yes and that she has been busy(tm). Finally she bangs out a date- five months later.\n\nPickles comes to the house with a mutual friend. She is very quiet, doesn't ask any questions or show much interest. Our mutual friend seems to be trying to sell her on the idea of living at the house. I ask if I can do a tenant interview - Pickles declines but our mutual pushes for said interview.\n\nI ask what I think are basic questions (what's your schedule? have you pets? are you a partier? drugs? what are your habits?). A lot of questions Pickles looks away from me. At the end I ask \"so, are you still interested in living here?\".\n\nPickles says: \"I have no other choice.\"\n\nThis interaction has been on my mind for the past three days. I know Pickles is saying she can't afford to live alone but it also feels like she doesn't want to live with me. Mutual friends have expressed concern about Pickles being unreliable and messy. I didnt get a good feeling from the interview and these concerns add to the pile.

Commuting to work 30 miles each way has led to my car looking like a bird feeder exploded inside. I\u2019m being dramatic but it needed a quick clean and vacuum. I have other things to do that are more important so I kept putting it off. My kids fell asleep at home and I decided the wife was good alone and I\u2019d go grocery shopping to cross that off my list. As I\u2019m driving I see a car wash I went to years back. I wasn\u2019t intending on doing this today but I took the opportunity and drove in. I always have cash. Well at least that\u2019s been the norm.  I pull in and take out my wallet and notice there is no cash. I don\u2019t know where it went but it\u2019s not there. Luckily the car wash is cashless so I stick my card in and pay for the most expensive option to treat my car. It\u2019s all computerized at the pay booth. There\u2019s no option to tip.  Now I pull up and greet the worker who is going to finish off my car with a nice vacuum and interior wash. I left my car and went inside desperate to figure out how to get cash. There is no atm and they don\u2019t have cash inside. I ask where the closest one is. The owner says a mile down the road. So now as I\u2019m waiting for a good twenty minutes I think I may have cash in my glove compartment. I tend to keep it for emergencies like this. Fast forward to the car being done. He waves me over and says I\u2019m good. I say thanks and get in my car to reach in the glove box. I see two $5 bills. He must\u2019ve thought I wasn\u2019t going to tip him so he says, \u201coh really, you fucker.\u201d  So I just quietly closed the glove box, closed my door, and drove away without giving him the cash.

When she asked me to drive her all the way to work instead I said no and when she asked a second time I declined to answer. This (for some reason) led her to believe that I had changed my answer. The reason I said no is because I work at 12 and I need time to go train before work because I won\u2019t be able to afterwards, and driving her to work would mean that I won\u2019t get to train. \n\nWhen we arrived at the metro she asked me what I was doing and when I told her that I was dropping her off here she immediately got angry, got out, and slammed the door. It\u2019s important to note that when I told her to just tell her coworker she\u2019ll be 10 minutes late she refused and said she\u2019s scheduled for 10. This is a job she claims to not care about, yet it seems a little too convenient for her to suddenly start caring when I wouldn\u2019t drive her all the way there. \n\nShe works full time and often finishes late.

That\u2019s why I suggested them walking to downtown, plenty of high-schoolers do it and I did it when I went to that school. It\u2019s not dangerous or anything\nEdit again: Also I don\u2019t go to school in my hometown. I\u2019m in college and my hometown is in between my college and BF.

There was no talk of Cindy being disabled or needing accommodation prior to their move in. Kirby and I were aware Cindy had mental health issues (as do we). Cindy was not employed at the time, but Kirby and I were under the impression that Cindy would be looking for employment sometime after moving in. It was discussed that Cindy wouldn't need to start paying for things right away, but that at *some* point they would be expected to help out. Kirby and I both work slightly above minimum wage fulltime jobs.\n\nSix months after move in: Kirby and I have essentially become Cindy's parents. She does not clean. She does not cook. Cindy expect us to pay for everything (rent, utilities, groceries, her personal hygiene items, etc.). She gets upset when Kirby and I don't buy what they want (ex. We own two nice mid-range water filters, but Cindy will get upset if we tell her the budget doesn't allow us to buy pop). Cindy expects us to cook most nights. She has expressed being upset we couldn't buy them pizza or pop, after I told them recently our bank account was overdrawn about $100.\n\nA couple nights ago Kirby and I sat them down to talk with them and express our need for help. Our talk pretty much boiled down to: Kirby and I will need [Cindy] to start buying her own personal items \/ whatever junk food we can't afford. We will need her to start helping with finances (we're asking $250 for all rent \/ utilities - our total rent \/ utilities cost 1k+ monthly) *once she is employed*, that if she expects us to cook for her, then we expect her to do the same sometime for us. Additionally *until* she is employed we asked that she do the dishes twice a week and change her cat's litter twice a week.\n\nCindy responded by telling us this was a betrayal of friendship and not to talk to her unless we needed something.\n\nLast night, she unprompted sent us a message about how she was trying to get on disability. (We have not responded.)\n\nTL;DR: Are we asking too much of Cindy, or is her behaviour towards us as toxic as it feels?

So I didn't choose one over the other. My GF had her birthday 3 months ago and my ex had her's last weekend. I have been together with my ex for almost ten years and am happy that we found a way to become friends after the breakup. My GF seems to be ok with that and she also knew I would be there. So no secrets here.\n\nMe and my GF are in a long distance relationship for almost a year now. Althought flights are pretty cheap (about 20$ to 30$ one way), it takes about 1 hour of flight and another 2 hours by train to get there. When she had her birthday, we just had seen each other 10 days before and I thought she didn't care so much about her birthday, so I didn't even consider it. She hadn't invited me either, so I didn't think it would matter to her. But as the day came, her friends seemed to have asked why I wasn't there and that got her thinking. She told me after, that she felt bad not being able to tell those people why I wasn't there and she felt embarassed. I understand that, but thought, it would be ok between us. When she asked me, why I hadn't been there, I answered that I simply thought, she didn't care. That made her angry.\n\nThree months on, the week before the birthday of my ex, we got into an argument and I chose to have some time for myself for the weekend. I went to the birthday from my ex and all was nice and relaxed and I enjoyed talking to the people. I barely spoke to my ex, so I don't see why she is now angry at me. It was a nice weekend and I wrote to my GF after. I didn't write for three days (she was texting me a bit during this time), but I felt I needed this time and I told her about it.\n\nShe knew I would be going there. I told her about needing some time for myself. It all seemed fine. But now she is grumpy and keeps bringing up her own birthday again.

One week before the concert I sold the ticket to someone else because she gave me a bad feeling. AITA ?)\n\nSo one month or so ago, I bought a ticket for a concert that is now in one week. But not being very happy about the seat I got, I decided to buy another one to someone who got a way better seat than mine, but was now left with an extra ticket. The website I got it from didn't have a refund policy, so here I am with two tickets, and being a broke college student, I needed the money back.\n\nI did a post on FB, reselling it for a bit less than its original price. I got some interested but nothing crazy, and after a week or search, I thought I found someone ! This girl messaged me, saying she was willing to take it because she didn't got one the day of the sale. I gave her all the infos she needed, and even if she always responded with kind of a dry tone, I was happy to finally have someone taking it. But then, it started to get more and more... Weird ?\n\nFirst, she told me she was going to pay by cash transfer, because we were not from the same city. Works for me, I did that before and here it takes like 2 minutes in every nearest store. So I waited. But she kept delaying the day she was going to do it, always with very short and dry answers. Then she told me she was going to pay by PayPal. But once again kept leaving me on read for days, and finally said to me that it wouldn't accept the payment or something like that. Of course I was disappointed, but she finally told me she was going to buy it the day of the concert. Not the best option but, eh... I have to sell it back. And I'm already too far to say no. Well, I thought so.\n\nDays go by and this girl is not even trying to message me back anymore. I asked her for more infos, when we would meet, if she was really going to take it, and even small talk because I don't know, she was so odd and giving me this bad feeling. Barely any responds, really shorts ones with some \"Don't worry\"s or so.\n\nBut yesterday, a girl I had already talked with posted in the groupe chat of the concert that she was looking for a ticket in the section I got. I couldn't help but message her, saying that I got one left. We talked for a bit, and even if we had small talks before, we got along really quick and I got a way better feeling about her. After a bit of negotiations, she finally told me she was willing to pay by card the next day (so today), so I can directly send her the ticket (And even print it for her if she wanted to.) But now I had to tell the other girl. And I feel bad. Even if she didn't bother being really helpful and trustful, I feel bad. The concert is next Sunday, and even if I got a bad feeling about her (and still do), I feel like an asshole, leaving her without anything one week before the concert.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA ?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","subreddit_id":"t5_2xhvq","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AmItheAsshole","subreddit_subscribers":1884765,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":"top","thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"AITA for selling someone's concert ticket to someone else ?","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex7xgh\/aita_for_selling_someones_concert_ticket_to\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":true,"archived":false,"author":"ammorgan465","author_created_utc":1561938024,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_41wvbs8j","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1580572003,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.AmItheAsshole","edited":1580573284,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"ex7xby","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#cc3600","link_flair_css_class":"ass","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"c122525a-d244-11e8-98e9-0e0449783b98","link_flair_text":"Everyone Sucks","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":17,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/ex7xby\/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_our_manager_called\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587270690,"score":5,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I've been working at a place for four+ months and started full-time around the new year.

last night for dinner, my mom, dad and brother (30) were having beef burgers and I (20F) was having something else (I don't eat meat or like fake meat so I cooked my own vegetarian meal); for a couple different reasons, we were eating dinner slightly later than usual. Not ridiculously later, but enough that we were all pretty hungry\/antsy. \n\nMy brother came upstairs a few minutes after he'd been told it was ready. He took the mustard and mayo off the table, which already annoyed my parents as they needed them to put their burgers together, and he took a couple extra minutes to put together a honey mustard sauce. My mom asked why he couldn't have made the sauce like 1\/2 an hour ago, and he just said 'oh it's fine not a big deal.' He literally took almost 5 minutes making this 4 ingredient honey mustard sauce, then finally brought the mayo and mustard to the table with the sauce.\n\nHe said he made enough for everyone to try, but my mom and dad just wanted regular burger toppings. The sauce didn't go with my dinner at all, and I said as much and see \"Ah well fuck me then.\" Well whatever; I don't like to mix cuisines in the same dish (I was having a Thai dish with spicy peanut sauce).\n\nThroughout dinner, he was pushing his honey mustard sauce on everyone at least 4 times. Finally, my mom relented and try a spoonful on the side. \"Yes it's good,\" she said and then my brother tried to get her to take more even though she said she was almost done and she was fine.\n\nHe offered my dad and I to try again and we said no, and he raised his voice and very dramatically said \"Well excuse me for trying to feed my family! Fuck me!\" \n\nI was pretty annoyed at this point because jeezus it's a just a honey mustard sauce. I don't eat meat and I never try this hard to push any of my vegetarian dishes on my people. I offer once, maybe twice for my dad because he usually won't accept the first time even if he wants it, then I shut up.\n\nSo I said to him \"How are you feeding the family? Mom and dad bought the food, mom cooked the dinner, I cooked my own dinner. You made a sauce that understandably not everyone wants to try. Shut up about the goddamn honey mustard.\"\n\nHe started half-laughing, half-fuming and said \"Whatever. Fuck me. I'm a good chef, I just wanted you guys to experience this. Fuck me.\"\n\nIt's fucking honey mustard. It wasn't even my sauce of choice when I used to eat meat and would eat chicken strips (I liked BBQ, my dad liked plum).

boyfriend's sister, who I call SIL because it works in my languague, once told me about the time she was touched inapropriately by a restaurant owner. She thought she was having a job interview, but the owner locked the door behind her and took advantage of her. Of course I expressed sympathy for her and asked if she had been okay. She reassured me that it hadn't left any scars since it was a long time ago and she had seen a therapist some years back.\n\nI asked her what happened to the restaurant owner and if she had reported the abuse. She said she didn't wish for the restaurant owner to lose his bussiness since she pitied him. She had instead gone back to the restaurant and told the owner that what he did had been really hurtful and he should never do that to anyone again. \n\nI basically said that I didn't think this was the right response to something like that happening to you. Of course the owner wouldn't feel remorse for that, he would just think he got away easy. Even worse, this allows him to continue doing this to other girls. My SIL said she still stand by forgiving this disgusting man because she genuinely believes he learned his lesson from a sixteen year old telling him off.

I've babysat my baby brother multiple times when I was 14-15, and even some of my cousins aged around 3-8 (where I live it's not illegal to do, so don't worry). I do this when I'm free on the weeked.\n\nMy town's pretty small and the people there are very busy sometimes. Combine that with the fact that there aren't many babysitters and well, news spread (via my mum who wanted me to do this) that I'm a good option.\n\nI voluntarily do my services for cheap, (I'll use the currency dollars to put it into perspective for most of you) approximately $2-3\/hour, sometimes even for free. The parents\/carers are always so surprised and amazed when they arrive back to see everything in perfect condition, and even more so when I tell them the price. They often offer more but I reject, because I just enjoy working with kids.\n\nThis one family took advantage of this though. I live alone with a few roommates, so this family I previously served multiple times called me and felt that they owed me a special Thanksgiving dinner because it was the least that they could do.\n\nI don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but I didn't want to be rude to their kind offer and decided that I would go. I drove there and we were having a good time eating and talking. My parents called to check on me so I excused myself to leave the room and go on a quick call with them and left. They must seen this as an opportunity of some sort, because the next thing you know they left quickly and left a note on the table saying \"Sorry! We'll be right back and pay you in full.\", and left me with a 4 year old boy and 3 year old girl.\n\nIt was late and I had plans to enjoy my Thanksgiving holiday and they ruined it. I obviously wasn't happy so I tried calling them 3 times but they didn't pick up. I dialled the non-emergency police number and when the officer showed up, I told him everything.\n\nThe parents turned up and the officer demanded their side of the story. They told him they had to attend an emergency community meeting. They were lucky not to get fined, but the officer gave them a strong reprimanding and left. They were confused and ticked off at me. I said \"you should have let me know and you practically left your kids with me without my consent. That's illegal\"\n\nI then told them \"don't expect me to babysit your kids here on out\". They've tried to call me numerous times that they need me and they apologise, but I wasn't having any of it. I told my parents and they thought I was being a little too harsh.\n\n**EDIT**: A LOT of you guys are confused at my contradictive phrasing. **I don't celebrate Thanksgiving**, but you can still celebrate the holiday with your own plans instead without actually celebrating the event. I know some non-Christian friends who decided to go on a vacation to France during the Christmas holidays, that doesn't necessarily mean that they \"celebrate Christmas\". It's just taking a break from all the stuff you usually do and having fun. If I'm making sense.\n\n**EDIT 2:** You guys are right. I ought to charge more. It seems like I undervalue my work and I don't. But with charge rates like that, it's very easy to be taken advantage of.

I decided to drive because I didn't want to drink and I wanted to save money by avoiding any ubers or anything. While trying to find somewhere to park, I pulled into a narrow, dead end street. The street was very poorly lit. Half way up the street I realised there would be no where to park my car on this street and wanted to try another. I decided that backing out of the street would be dangerous, considering the area was so poorly lit. I decided to turn the car around. This was easier said than one however because I literally had to do a 30 point turn to get my tiny car around. Because of the lack of light and how tight it was, I ended up scraping another car very very lightly. There was virtually no damage to my cars paint besides a tiny bit but I could see that I had taken off a little bit of the other cars paint. I wrote them a note apologising and left my insurance details. I called my mum soon after (she owns the car) explaining what happened and that I left a note. Mum was not happy. And I get that - I totally accept responsibility for scraping the other car. It was an unfortunate accident.

I (21M) left for a holiday by car with my immediate family. We were about an hour in when somehow the topic of weddings came up. The conversation turned to some people in my school year who had recently gotten engaged and married, as some tend to start doing around my age.\n\nMy mother always wants to know all the details about everything, even if she doesn\u2019t know the people involved particularly well. It got to the point where she asked to see the wedding photos on Facebook of one person I went to school with who had gotten married a couple of months earlier (someone I have not talked to since I finished school - just because we weren\u2019t extremely close at school and we naturally drifted apart). I replied saying I couldn\u2019t recall seeing any wedding photos posted on Facebook. She then asked to see his Facebook profile. I said I would check his profile to see if perhaps I had somehow missed seeing any photos. \n\nUpon checking there were no wedding photos that he had posted. I told her as much, but she still insisted on seeing his profile. I said there were no wedding photos on there so there was no reason to see his profile - there was absolutely nothing \u201cbad\u201d on his profile that would be awkward knowing your mother was seeing it, but it felt weird showing her one of my old school friend\u2019s private Facebook profile when there was no specific reason to. I felt like she was being unreasonably nosy, but perhaps that\u2019s my naturally private side coming out. She still insisted on seeing his profile, and despite asking several times why she wanted to, all she said was \u201cI just want to see\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m your mother, you should show me if I want to see\u201d. I still refused, leading her to accuse me of hiding something on my phone, and saying all my friends wouldn\u2019t treat their mothers like this. She then said I was \u201cexercising control over women\u201d (a frankly bizarre statement that I took some offence to - I am a strong believer in gender equality and don\u2019t believe I have ever done anything that would indicate otherwise), and then yelled at me that I was ruining the start to the holiday.\n\nI think that, especially at my age, I can show her or not show her whatever I want on my personal social media within reason, and that she was being unreasonable and her reaction was ridiculous. Clearly, she thinks I was being unreasonable by not showing her whatever she asked and was treating her badly.

Basically the person I\u2019m taking about I will call FR, because I don\u2019t want to keep referring to him as a random person.\n\nBefore I explain any further I want to give a rundown of what type of person FR is, his attitude is horrible, he starts arguments left and right, and when he loses them or is proven wrong(as usual) he giggles it off and there is this small period of time where he will act really nice to the person he argued with right after he \u201closes\u201d the argument. FR basically buys his friends as he is \u201cfriends\u201d with this group of girls who basically ignore him but they tolerate him since he buys them gifts for Christmas and each of their birthdays. \n\nFR is quite bad at the video game, always feeds and doesn\u2019t try to improve, he giggles when he is told to try this or that to get better and ends up making the same mistake over and over again. His level in the game isn\u2019t a level he deserves as he adds people who carry him and invite them to my friend discord server therefore he can\u2019t get better. \n\nFR is quite two faced, he has talked behind everyone\u2019s backs to everyone, I didn\u2019t find it a problem at first but people kept on getting hurt so when I disregarded it and just tried to distance myself from him, he talked behind my back to my best friend and called me a whore. I can\u2019t really say or do anything about that but it did really hurt me and I tried to confront him about it but he acted like a child as he does and giggled it off.\n\nFR has been flamed by others quite a lot and gets defensive about it but he flames others when they make the tiniest mistake. So I had a talk with the person who flamed him so that he could have a better time playing with all of us. But then more than 3 people of my already small discord server has complained about not wanting to play with FR so I made a channel he can\u2019t see or join but everyone else can join. We use it all the time and he found out about it recently due to one of my friends streaming the gameplay. I got really mad and brought up the two faced situation because we did talk a little behind his back since I needed to explain to a new friend why this channel was here and why FR couldn\u2019t see it.\n\nI feel like a bad person but another half of me thinks that it\u2019s well deserved.

As my family does not have many conditions to buy another one in case it breaks, I am very careful with it. I don't use it on a television, I use it on a monitor that I borrowed from my uncle. This uncle had a son with his ex-girlfriend, and she is moving to another state, so she left her son (1yo) with him at my house (I live with my mother, grandmother and uncles).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoils this boy a lot, and this boy is imitating me in the video game, at first I didn't even care, I started to worry about a day that I spent the day outside the house and when I arrived I saw the boy with the control in the kitchen and the video game turned on the floor (just to put a little more context, my video game is between 2 sofas that are L-shaped and when I stop playing I close the sofas so he doesn't get in).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, today I was playing and when I finished I did the same thing as always, closed the sofas, and a few seconds later my uncle asked to open the door for him and out of nowhere he sat on the couch and said: '' Go play, Jo\u00e3o! '' (Jo\u00e3o is his son's name) and he opened the sofa at the same time I opened the door, I turned around he looked at me and said: '' You don't have to keep closing the sofa so he doesn't get in '' and so I went to the kitchen.

I called her back and asked her why she left that message. She said she had a feeling that something might be wrong with me. Like an intuition. I told her I was fine and that was it. I feel incredibly guilty for not telling her about my robbery. The reason why I didn't was because my mom has a big mouth and makes everything about her.

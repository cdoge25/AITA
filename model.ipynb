      "So I live in an apartment complex with thin walls. I can hear everything. I normally don’t mind when it’s like normal living sounds like walking or closing a door, but my upstairs neighbors are absolutely obnoxious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every night between 11 pm and 3 am they bang really loudly on their own doors. I have absolutely no clue why they would do that but the sound of a door being banged on is pretty recognizable. I tried to think if it was something else but the sound couldn’t be anything other than an extremely loud knock. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every Saturday morning they have a cook out (hot dogs at 8 am? Not sure why but who am I to judge) they do this right outside my window and blast loud music. I never call in a noise complaint on Saturdays because I couldn’t bear the thought of making their family go back into their house and ruin their fun, so I’d just put a pillow over my head and try to sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every Sunday now for about three or four weeks they’d start construction on their bathroom which happens to be right above my bedroom. This construction consists of loud power tools and hammering. What time did they start this? Every Sunday at 5:45 AM sharp. By the third Sunday I had had enough, I worked until 1 am the night before and didn’t get to go to bed until around 2:30 because I had some cleaning I needed todo. I called in a noise complaint to the front desk and they were told to not start construction again until a reasonable time for most people to be awake on a Sunday. They interpreted that as 6:15 am! And continued. \n",

      "I think they know I called the complaint because when they saw me coming to the elevator a couple days later they quickly closed the door and wouldn’t let me in. They must have been pretty upset. I am only reminded of that because tonight at around 11:40 pm they decided it was a good time to vacuum their whole apartment. \n",

    "- for small to moderately sized datasets, the default 'auto' setting often works well. For larger datasets, experimenting with 'ball_tree' or 'kd_tree' might be beneficial. For very small datasets or high-dimensional data, 'brute' might be a reasonable choice.\n",

    "- 'kd_tree': higher_dimention + large size\n",

    "- choose the best n_neighbors by variety of methods: Grid Search or Random Search and Plot Accuracy vs. n_neighbors\n",
    "2. Logistic regression\n",
    "- solver='lbfgs' is an argument in Logistic regression. It specifies the optimization algorithm to be used for training the logistic regression model. It suits for a large number of variables data and to be efficient in terms of memory usage.\n",
    "- Choose the best K for F-fold cross validation by: Common Choices for k(not too high or low to balance bias and variance), data size Considerations(large size need to choose small k to optimal performance), use cross_val_score\n",
    "- bias: using simple model for complex data leading to overfiting phenomenom, it means causing a low accuracy since the model can't capture all featured patterns in the data  \n",
    "- variace: occasionally, causing by the opposite reason of bias, leading to overfitting with a high accuracy in training-set but a low accuracy in testing-set\n",
    "- The accuracy_score function in scikit-learn does not have an average argument because accuracy is a single value that represents the overall correctness of predictions and is not computed separately for each class in a multiclass classification problem.\n",

    "- \"liner\" kernel, Suitable for high-dimensional data or datasets where the number of features is large compared to the number of samples. For large text datasets, the 'linear' kernel is often a good starting point for computational efficiency.\n",
